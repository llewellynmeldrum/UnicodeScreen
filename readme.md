# img2uniscr 
Turns your terminal into a (terrible) screen, making use of the "▀" unicode glyph, each row of your terminal becomes two rows of 3-bit RGB pixels.

*here you can see the *beautiful* 3 bit color depth.*



# External Build Dependencies
*TODO: add a cmake to install dependencies automatically.*
### Ncurses
Necessary to build any branches. Avaliable on homebrew: 
``` bash
    brew install ncurses
```


# Usage 
Pass in an image to the program:
```bash
   ./img2uniscr <path/to/image> 
```
And it should open up in glorious 3 bit color!

> [!NOTE] 
> *if you see repeated strings of �, this is probably your terminal trying to optimise drawing code. I've only observed this in iterm2 so far, so try it out in terminal if youre on mac.*


# Constraints
At the moment, it is assumed that your terminal is using the default values for ANSI colors set by modern macOS terminals. Exact values dont matter much, as the colors get compressed to hell anyway. As long as your terminal colors roughly match (i.e your yellow is actually yellow), it should be fine. 

Any images with width or height >96 currently arent processed properly, as my resizing implementation is broken. Will fix soon.


# Libraries Used
### ncurses.h
Provides a "terminal mode" for displaying chars. Its not really necessary for still images, but as this project expands to video I think it will prove useful.
``` c
    #define _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED // necessary for wide chars
    #include <ncurses.h>
```

### stb_image.h and stb_image_resize2.h
Single header libraries, very easy to include. Provides extremely simple interface for opening and reading image data.


# External Tools Used

## Makefile
the Makefile was generated by `chatgpt-4o`. I hate writing Makefiles. Forgive me, until I learn cmake.

## bear
Tool to auto generate `compile_commands.json` for LSP to understand the project structure. Works with nvim.


# Directory Breakdown
TODO: Upon completion, add a rough directory breakdown using `tree`.

# Q/A
## Why c11? 
Usually just default to c99, figured i'd check out c11. I know it added or improved the _Generic macro for function overloading, I hope to check that out at some point. I also believe it has multithreading improvements, although I cant really imagine using mutlithreading for this project.
